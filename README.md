# Calendar-Homework

This is an app for a daily planner.  It's purpose is to let users interact with a list schedule of different hours of the day presented in the form of time blocks.  

When the user clicks inside of the time block of their choosing, they are then allowed to enter data into that field.  This data can be anything, but in general is meant for daily reminders, and not something as long as a grocery list, for example.  

Once the user has entered the data next to the correlating time slot where they are scheduling their event, they can click on the button to the right of that row to save their data.  This data is stored to local storage, and stays stored in that block, even if the page is refreshed.  

Users also have the convenience of knowing whether their events occur in the future, the present or the past, based on the color shades of the timeblocks.
